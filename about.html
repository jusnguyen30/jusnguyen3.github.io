<h1>About Me</h1>
    <center><p>I am a sophomore computer science student at the University of Houston seeking a software engineering internship.</p>
    <p>As part of the Real-Time Systems lab at UH, I have been conducting research in the area of real-time task scheduling since Summer 2018.</p>
    <p>Through my experiences conducting research and working on individual side projects, I have been able to develop my skills in core languages such as C++, Java, & Python, as well as other technologies such as HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, I aspire to employ the use of technology to effect social change and better society.</p>
